## Brass

### Trumpet

The standard trumpet range extends from the written F♯ immediately below Middle C up to about three octaves higher. Traditional trumpet repertoire rarely calls for notes beyond this range, and the fingering tables of most method books peak at the high C, two octaves above middle C.

Roughly, middle C to to octaves above.

### Trombone

E an octave and a half below middle C, ?

## Woodwinds

### Saxophone

#### Soprano

A transposing instrument pitched in the key of B♭, modern soprano saxophones with a high F# key have a range from A♭3 to E6 and are therefore pitched one octave above the tenor saxophone. Some saxophones have additional keys, allowing them to play an additional F♯ and G at the top of the range. These extra keys are commonly found on more modern saxophones. Additionally, skilled players can make use of the Altissimo register, which allows them to play even higher. There is also a soprano pitched in C, which is less common and has not been made since around 1940.

#### Alto

The range of the alto saxophone is from concert D♭3 (the D♭ below middle C—see Scientific pitch notation) to concert A♭5 (or A5 on altos with a high F♯ key). As with most types of saxophones, the standard written range is B♭3 to F6 (or F♯6). Above that, the altissimo register begins at F♯ and extends upwards. The saxophone's altissimo register is more difficult to control than that of other woodwinds and is usually only expected from advanced players.

Roughly, Bb 10th below middle C, F ?octaves above middle C

#### Tenor

Modern tenor saxophones which have a high F# key have a range from A♭2 to E5 (concert) and are therefore pitched one octave below the soprano saxophone.

Roughly, Ab 2 octaves below middle C, E ?octaves above middle C

#### Baritone

From concert D♭2 (Sometimes C2) to A♭4. Many models have a key for a (written) low A (instead of the usual low B♭) and/or a key for high F♯.
