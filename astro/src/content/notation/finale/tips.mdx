## Tips and Tricks

### Staff Set

Select Staff Set submenu
You can significantly speed up your work on orchestral scores by hiding the staves you’re not currently editing so that there’s less music for Finale to draw. You can create up to eight Staff Sets—different arrangements of the staves in your music. This method only changes the display in Scroll View.

All Staves. Choose this command to display all the staves in your score in Scroll View. This Staff Set cannot be reassigned.
Staff Set 1 • … • 8. Choose from these commands to display the staves you assigned to the corresponding Staff Set.

To create a Staff Set, click the Staff tool icon; select only the staves you want to appear when you choose this command. Next, while pressing CTRL (hold after selection, then go to the menu while holding, Progam staff set should appear in the dropdown), choose a Staff Set from the View > Staff Set submenu to define it.
