## Mixing

To mix individual drums (e.g. "kick"), right click a note, select all by pitch, then adjust the velocity.

The Inspector allows you to change MIDI velocity directly. So, for instance, right-click a given drum note, Select / More / Same pitch, then add an offset to the velocity, to change the volume of all snare notes or whatever.
