## Groove

"According to a study (citation needed), the groove adjustment is applied in increments of 5 milliseconds. For beats 2 and 4, a setting of -5 ms results in a subtle 'on top' feel, while -10 ms produces a 'very on top' effect. Similarly, positive values (e.g., +5 ms, +10 ms) create a 'laid-back' feel by delaying the beats slightly."

### Latin Groove

Set a swing of 52% for a laid back groove.
