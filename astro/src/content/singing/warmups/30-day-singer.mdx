## 30 Day Singer

[30 day warmup](https://www.30daysinger.com/tutorial/practice-routine-for-better-intonation-singers-who-struggle-with-pitch/2)

We’ll begin singing with a sighing hum. Although your mouth is closed, keep space inside as if you were singing an “ah” vowel. Nice and relaxed!

[Exercise: Sighing hum 5-1-5]

Now with a round, spacious OO vowel. Maintain some yawn space in the back of your throat so the soft palate lifts.

[Exercise: HOO 1-3-5]

Sticking with the OO vowel, add an initial “G” sound for this next one. The “g” brings our vocal folds together, so we can train strong cord closure.

[Exercise: GOO 5-3-1]

Final warmup: a relaxing lip trill. Connect to your breath support muscles so your body is active, but your throat and face stay relaxed.

[Exercise: Lip trill 1-3-1]
