### Part 1

We’ll begin with numbers, but feel free to use an easy vowel or syllable once you’re comfortable with the pattern.

Our first pattern uses just three pitches. We’ll sing them ascending, descending, and then put it together. Practice with me first: ascending, descending, and all together. Keep going with the piano!

[Exercise: 1-2-3 3-2-1 1-2-3-2-1]

Expanding on that exercise, add two more step. Try that pattern with me, ascending. Descending. And put the two together. Let’s keep going!

[Exercise: 1-2-3-4-5 5-4-3-2-1 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1]

Quick note here: there are two kinds of steps. They are a whole step and a half step. Sing this with me to feel the difference: [whole step up, whole step]. Your turn. Now try it with a half step: [half step, half step]. You alone.

We sang only whole steps in our first pattern: [1-2-3-2-1]. But in our second pattern, we had 1 half-step. Do you know where it was? I’ll play the pattern and see if you can hear the single half step. [play 1-2-3-4-5].

Here’s the answer: the half-step occurs between 3 and 4.

When we talk about intervals, or the distance between two pitches, we’d use the term “major second” for a whole step, and “minor second” for a half step.

Let’s end with the major scale. A scale is a set of pitches in a specific order. The major scale is stepwise; it has 2 half-steps, and the rest are whole steps. See if you can find them.

The first one, you already know: between 3 and 4. The second occurs between 7 and 8.

We’ll sing a full major scale ascending, descending, and then put it together. Follow along as we practice, ascending. Descending, starting on 8. And all together, from 1. Keep it going!

### Part 2

Most melodies aren’t just stepwise. They also contain leaps, like this. When you first learn to read music, you practice identifying these as skips and steps.

We’re going to start with an arpeggiated chord. A chord consists of more than one pitch, played at the same time. Usually, a chord is built using three or more pitches. When you arpeggiate a chord, you play or sing those pitches individually.

Practice with me on a major chord, which sounds like this. Again, we’ll start on numbers, but you can transition to a vowel or syllable if you’re ready for a challenge. Sing [1-3-5]; [echo]. [5-3-1]. And put it together: [1-3-5-3-1]. Your turn. Nice! Keep going with the piano.

[Exercise: 1-3-5 5-3-1 1-3-5-3-1]

Do you know what those intervals were called? Recall that a step is also called a second. With our arpeggiated chord, we’re singing thirds. 1 to 3 is called a major third. Practice singing that with me, first ascending, and descending.

3 to 5 is called a minor third. Sing that with me, first ascending, and descending.

Let’s complete our major scale pattern with the highest pitch on top. Sing on numbers first, ascending. And descending, start on 8. The whole thing, from 1 to 8 and back.

[Exercise: 1-3-5-8 8-5-3-1 1-3-5-8-5-3-1]

### Part 3

Fourths and fifths! Now, there are a handful of intervals that are not major and minor. Unison, fourths, fifths, and octaves are called “perfect”.

So let’s sing a perfect fourth, on numbers: [1 4 + echo]. Now sing the interval name: [perfect fourth + echo]. Next up: perfect fifth. On numbers: [1 5 + echo]. And with the name: [perfect fifth + echo]. Great!

Now, a little sidebar: we’re learning the intervals that occur within the major scale. Just as there are major and minor thirds, there are also major and minor 6ths and 7ths. But we’re sticking with major.  

This is a major 6th. And with that, we’re officially in large leap territory. Congratulations! Sing on numbers: [1 6 + echo]. And sing the name: [major 6th + echo]. We’re almost there! This is a fun one, a major 7th. Sing on numbers: [1 7 + echo]. With the name: [major 7th + echo].

Final interval of the day: a perfect octave. Sing on numbers: [1 8 + echo]. And the name: [perfect octave + echo].

Now, we’ll practice every interval we’ve learned with a major scale bungee. I’ll sing through, and feel free to follow along. Then I’ll just play, while you sing!

 Here’s one last exercise to tie it all together, combining stepwise motion, an arpeggiated chord, and large leaps. Are you ready?

Now, I recommend numbers for this one so you don’t get lost; but as always, you can sing on a vowel or easy syllable if you’d like. Let’s break it down really fast. The last part starts on the note you just sang, [5; 5 8 1]. Sing that alone: [5 8 1]. Put it together! And finish out strong!
